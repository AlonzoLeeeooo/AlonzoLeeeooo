### Survey GitHub Repos ðŸ“‚

I have maintained a series of GitHub repos to record the update-to-date resources of different research directions. Currently, my research interests involve:
- [Image Inpainting](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-image-inpainting-studies)
- [Text-to-Image Generation](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-text-to-image-studies)
- [Video Generation](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-video-generation)
- [Radiology Report Generation](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-radiology-report-generation)

All survey GitHub repos will be dynamically updated with newly released papers and resources. More research directions will be updated IN THIS DOCUMENT in the future. Starting new issues and PRs is always welcome in all repos.

Specifically, you can find more details about the Radiology Report Generation (RRG) topic in my survey paper titled ["A Systematic Review of Deep Learning-based Research on Radiology Report Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14199).

If you find these repos helpful to you, follow my [GitHub account](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo) and stay tuned!
