### Hi there 👋
![github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=AlonzoLeeeooo&show_icons=true)

🧑🏻‍🎓 I am currently a PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Dong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lOWByxoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

🔍 My research direction involves a wide series of applications based on generative models such as GANs, Transformers, and diffusion models. For now, I am mainly interested in these tasks: *image inpainting*, *text-to-image generation*, and *video generation*.

📂 To record up-to-date resources of the aforementioned research directions, I have maintained some GitHub repos, including:
- [<u>1. Text-to-Image Generation</u>](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-text-to-image-studies): A collection of resources for text-to-image generation studies.
- [<u>2. Video Generation</u>](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-video-generation): A collection of resources for video generation studies.
- [<u>3. Image Inpainting</u>](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/awesome-image-inpainting-studies): A collection of resources for image inpainting studies.

🧪 I have re-produced/re-implemented some works, which are open-sourced for potential usage by the community:
- [<u>1. Shape-Guided ControlNet</u>](https://github.com/AlonzoLeeeooo/shape-guided-controlnet): A re-implementation of ControlNet trained with shape masks.
