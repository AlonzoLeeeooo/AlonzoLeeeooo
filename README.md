### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=alonzoleeeooo&show_icons=true)

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research direction involves a series of multi-modal applications, e.g., text-to-image generation, image description generation, radiology report generation, etc.
I am also interested in some particular model architecture, e.g., diffusion model, large language model.
If you have any problems about my research or me, please feel free to contact me via e-mail (lc980413@mail.ustc.edu.cn).
