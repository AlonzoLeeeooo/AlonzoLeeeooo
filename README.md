### Hi there 👋
![github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=AlonzoLeeeooo&show_icons=true)

🧑🏻‍🎓 I am currently a PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Dong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lOWByxoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

🔍 My research direction involves a wide series of applications based on generative models such as GANs, Transformers, and diffusion models. For now, I am mainly interested in these tasks: image inpainting, text-to-image generation, and video generation.

📂 To record up-to-date resources of the aforementioned research directions, I have maintained some GitHub repos, which you can find [here](./survey-topics.md).
Newly published papers and resources will be updated in these repos.

🤝 I am looking for long-term collaboration in ground-breaking projects in computer vision, please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
