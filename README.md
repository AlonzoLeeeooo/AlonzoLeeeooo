### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

My research direction involves a wide series of multi-modal applications, e.g., text-to-image generation, image description generation, radiology report generation, etc. And I am also interested in some particular model architecture, e.g., diffusion model, large language model.

The code and related resources of my research are available at [https://github.com/synlp](https://github.com/synlp). We are a creative and productive team. For more information, please refer to our GitHub repository..

If you have any about my research or me, please feel free to contact me via e-mail (lc980413@mail.ustc.edu.cn).
