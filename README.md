### Hi there 👋

🧑🏻‍🎓 I am currently a PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

🔍 My research direction involves a wide series of applications based on diffusion models, e.g., image inpainting, text-to-image generation, video generation, and etc.

📂 To record up-to-date resources of the aforementioned research directions, I have maintained some GitHub repos, which you can find [here](./survey-topics.md).
Newly published papers and resources will be updated in these repos.

🤝 I am always welcome to long-term collaboration, please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
